Example 1 explanation
this hello world displayed with different main.cpp(c++ language) where we use
#include <iostream>: include input, output library , this include library that aloows us to use cout
(to print message) and cin(to read an integer from standard input)
using namespace std;:use standard namespace, this makes writing simpler
int main():main function , this is where program start.
return 0;:this indicate successfully execution.

Example 2 explanation
Using data type and Valuables to display the output and we can not use special characters or space and even case sensitive 
because Age is different from age, the first one start with upper case and the second one start with lower case.
must start with a letter or under scores(_).
we have to declare their data type like int, float, double, bool, string.

Example 3 explanation.
For this one ,how it works:	cin >> name; ? Takes user input for the variable name. 
•	cin >> age; ? Takes user input for age. 
•	The values are then printed back to the user. 
here we try running this program and enter different names and ages!
